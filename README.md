# Pipeline-Verilog
32-bit MIPS32 RISC Processor implemented in Verilog. Features a 5-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB) for high-throughput instruction execution. 
Key Highlights: 
Supports Arithmetic, Logic, Memory (LW/SW), and Branch instructions. 
32x32-bit Register File. 
Two-phase clocking for stability. 
Optimized for modular hardware modeling.
